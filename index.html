                        the
                        CBSE
                        (Grades 1-12). The school is owned and managed by the Anandilal & Ganesh Podar Society. At RN
                        Podar School we take great pride in our endeavour to arm students with essential
                        knowledge
                        and skills; in particular the ability and confidence to study, understand, and apply – so
                        that
                        they can successfully follow whatever path they choose in life. There is something special

                            particular
                            ethos, a rare quality of its own, which has been kept alive over the years. It offers a
                            friendly, caring, and safe environment with zero tolerance for bullying and a method of
                            study
                            which ensures that children really understand and can therefore use the information that
                            they
                            learn. At RN Podar, students are given the tools that allow them to feel really passionate
                            about
                            learning – whether it’s History, Art, Mathematics, Physics or any other field of study.
                            Applying
                            these tools, they can become more than students; they have the potential to become

                            Working with teenagers year on year, we have realized that the turmoil that adolescents
                            experience requires a focussed, concerted effort. As the lines separating childhood and
                            adulthood disappear, our youth faces a myriad of dilemmas not just in their academics but
                            also social interactions and personal management.

                            Life skills is an initiative born out of this felt need. Life skills sessions are designed
                            around self discovery, self improvement, and peer-to-peer support. The facilitator creates
                            an atmosphere where the young adult may feel free, express, be heard, and seek solutions.
                            Our life skills education happens through workshops, classroom sessions, collaborative
                            activities, and class-wise performance-based Special Assemblies. Grades 1-5 use the exciting
                            School Cinema modules for life skills.

                            We have seen gawky youngsters struggle with 'information overload', painfully unsure of
                            their future. We have then seen them being transformed into emotionally strong, confident
                            youth, ready to take on the world.</p>

                                        Yet another time, R. N. Podar has marked its name on the globe. In the competition organised by CERN (Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire), Geneva for schools, R. N. Podar’s team has won a fully funded trip to visit the CERN, and carry on their experiment. Being the first team to win this competition in the Asia Zone, the school’s team Cryptic Ontics has competed with 950 other teams internationally.

CERN, Beamline for Schools gives chance to high school students all over the world to propose a scientific experiment and depending upon the creativity, originality, feasibility and many other factors, jury selects one team and fully funds the team to visit Geneva campus, and work with the professors, engineers and other experts at CERN on cutting edge accelerator physics. The teams have to submit a research proposal document as well as a minute long video explaining their experiment.

Cryptic Ontics consisting of — Kiranbaskar Velmurugan, Pulkit Malhotra, Aditya Dwarkesh, Satchit Chatterji, Jinal Shah, Anushree Ganesh, Aayush Desai and Roshni Sahoo along with two coaches Shyam Wuppuluri and Rajeev Maurya, travelled to CERN, to carry on the experiment to study certain heuristics corresponding to the interaction between magnetic field and elementary particles – particularly cosmic muons.

During their stay, their greatest take away was to work with scientists at close quarters, examine their working methodologies, performing experiment, collecting the data, computing the data, and presenting the same. Cherry on the cake was to meet the Director General Fabiola Gionatti and run her through the proposal.

After their return, the team has to continue analysing the data obtained at CERN and publish a research paper in a peer reviewed scientific journal. Bhabha Atomic Research Center along with Department of Atomic Energy on the eve of Founder’s day has also felicitated the team after their return.

This event has been widely covered in news papers and other media. Ministry of external affairs has also acknowledged the success by uploading the pictures on their website.
